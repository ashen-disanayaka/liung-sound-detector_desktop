# lungsound_detector

this is a desktop application user interface of our lung sound classification system project 

## Getting Started
First of all designed user Interfaces using Figma software and developed the UI using flutter development framework using dart language. To develop a desktop application with Flutter, you can use the Flutter Desktop Embedding project. This project allows you to take a Flutter app and run it as a desktop application on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
To get started with Flutter desktop development, you will need to install the Flutter SDK and set up an editor of your choice. Visual Studio Code is a popular choice for Flutter development. You will also need to install the Flutter extension for Visual Studio Code.
Once you have set up your development environment, you can create a new Flutter project and specify that you want to target the desktop platform. There are a few differences between developing a desktop app with Flutter and a mobile app. For example, desktop apps typically have more screen real estate and may require a different layout and user interface. Additionally, desktop apps often have additional functionality such as support for keyboard shortcuts and drag-and-drop. Flutter provides a number of APIs and widgets specifically designed for building desktop apps, such as DesktopApp and GlobalKeyboardHooks.
Overall, Flutter makes it relatively easy to develop cross-platform apps for mobile, web, and desktop. Its hot reload feature allows for rapid development and testing, and its extensive widget library provides a wide range of options for building beautiful and functional user interfaces
